abstract={Application of weather radar data in urban hydrological applications has evolved significantly during the past decade as an alternative to traditional rainfall observations with rain gauges.

Three key areas with significant advances over the past decade have been identified: (1) temporal and spatial resolution of rainfall data required for different types of hydrological applications, (2) rainfall estimation, radar data adjustment and data quality, and (3) nowcasting of radar rainfall and real-time applications. Based on these three fields of research, the paper provides recommendations based on an updated overview of shortcomings, gains, and novel developments in relation to urban hydrological applications.

title={Mountain precipitation analysis for the estimation of flood runoff in coastal British Columbia},
volume={953594.},
abstract={A study of the precipitation distribution in coastal British Columbia is described and a technique is proposed for the reliable estimation of the frequency of rainfall generated floods from ungauged watersheds in the region. Based on an assessment of the atmospheric processes which affect climate, it was found that the strong frontal storms which form over the North Pacific Ocean and travel eastward generate the majority of the precipitation during the winter and fall months, whereas convective rainshowers and weak frontal storms produce the dry summer period precipitation. Examination of the annual, seasonal, and monthly precipitation in the two study watersheds, the Seymour River and the Capilano River watersheds, showed that the variation of annual and winter and fall precipitation with elevation follows a curvilinear pattern, increasing up to middle position of the watersheds at an elevation of about 400 m and then decreasing or levelling off at the upper elevations. The summer precipitation is more uniformly distributed over the watersheds than the winter precipitation and accounts for about 25% of the total annual precipitation. The Bergeron two-cloud mechanism has been identified as the dominant rainfall producing mechanism during the winter and fall months. Study of the 175 storms in the Seymour River watershed showed that the individual storm precipitation is distributed in a pattern similar to that of the annual precipitation and this distribution pattern is not affected by the type of the event. With regard to the development of techniques for the better estimation of flood runoff, a 24-hour design storm has been developed by using the data from the Seymour River watershed. Analysis of its spatial distribution revealed that this 24-hour design storm is distributed in a similar patter to that of the annual precipitation. Also, it was found that the 24-hour extreme rainfall of various return periods is a certain percentage of the mean annual precipitation. Comparison with regional data and results of other regional studies showed that the developed design storm can be transposed over the whole coastal region of British Columbia. A comparative study and rainfall-runoff simulation for a real watershed showed that from the widely used synthetic hyetographs, only the Soil Conservation Service Type IA storm or the 10% time probability distribution curve of this study can accurately generate the flood runoff from watersheds of the region. The above results of the short-term precipitation distribution with elevation and in time were tested for extreme storms. Five periods of historical large flood producing storms were analyzed and it was shown that the findings of the short-term precipitation analyses are valid for these extreme storms. The above results of the analysis of precipitation in coastal British Columbia and the findings of previous research on the watershed response of coastal mountainous watersheds have been combined and used for the development of a physically-based stochastic-deterministic procedure. The method is reliable and efficient, and requires very limited data, which can be found from a topographical map and the Rainfall Frequency Atlas for Canada. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

title={Elevation effects on rainfall: A stochastic model},
journal={Journal of Hydrology},
volume={18},

pages={21-35},
abstract={The variation in point precipitation with elevation is investigated using an event-based stochastic model of thunderstorm rainfall and empirical data. Parameters of the model correspond to the number of events per unit of time and the depth of rainfall per event. An increase in precipitation with elevation may be due to an increase in the number of events, in the amount of rainfall per event or to some combination of both possibilities. The distribution of the number of events per season is assumed to be a Poisson variate while the distribution of point rainfall depths may be taken as geometric. The summation of a random number of random variables is used to represent seasonal point precipitation. Assuming that the two parameters of the model increase linearly with elevation, then total seasonal rainfall increases as a quadratic polynomial with elevation. The use of the model allows one to obtain the return period of storm rainfall of a given magnitude despite a short historical record. An independent set of data was used to verify the procedure.},
